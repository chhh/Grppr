# Grppr
**Grppr (Grouper)** - Software for general 2D isotopic grouping. Can be applied
to LC-MS (liquid chromatography) or IM-MS (ion mobility) datasets. For LC-MS
the whole run is processed at once, for IM-MS each ion mobility scan is
processed separately. Using the Averagine peptide model can infer the location
of the monoisotopic peak even when it is not visible.  
**IMTBX (Ion Mobility Toolbox)** - 2D signal extraction tools for ion-mobility
coupled mass-spectrometry. See [this repository](https://github.com/chhh/IMTBX)
for more info.


## Downloads
